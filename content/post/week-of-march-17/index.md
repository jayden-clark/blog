## SF The Week of March 17th  
Here is what you should be listening to this week in San Francisco.  

### Keys Jazz Bistro, March 21-22 - The Kenny Washington Quartet  
My only recommendation for the Bay Area this week, but it’s a good one. Kenny Washington is a local who has played with basically every jazz great in his illustrious career. A sideman with musicians like Benny Green and Wynton Marsalis’s Lincoln Center Orchestra, Kenny is a master of traditional jazz drumming.  

A special mention to the venue, Keys Jazz Bistro, which was opened by my former director and mentor, Simon Rowe. He has done a spectacular job setting up the place. He was bold enough to open Keys just after the COVID madness subsided and has made a great bet. You can often hear him playing late sets on the organ at his club, and he’s always worth listening to!

## NYC The Week of March 17th  
Here is what you should go listen to this week in New York City.  

### Smoke, March 20-23 - Theo Croker  
My top choice this week is Theo Croker. When I was in college in San Francisco, my peers and I would always make the 11 PM pilgrimage through the Tenderloin to the Black Cat jazz club to hear Theo play whenever he was in town. He would always call me up to play a few tunes with him. He’s a true original and a master of the trumpet. His music is a perfect mix of neo-soul, traditional jazz and traditional African rhythm. His recent albums have been much more experimental and heavily produced, so it’s likely that’s what he will draw from for this gig. Go to this!

**Listening guide:**  
- Theo Croker - *Escape Velocity*  
- Theo Croker - *Star People Nation*  

### The Jazz Gallery, March 20-22 - TRION  
TRION is made up of saxophonist Chris Potter, bassist Linda May Han Oh, and is led by drummer Johnathan Blake. As a saxophonist, I’m there for Chris Potter, as he is probably the greatest tenor saxophone player on the planet right now. If anyone asks me, “Who is the best at saxophone?” my answer is—and has been—Chris Potter for years.  

I’m doing an injustice to both Linda Oh (fellow Australian) and Johnathan Blake in my raving, but Chris Potter, to me, is just that good.

**Listening guide:**  
- Chris Potter - *Lift - Live at the Village Vanguard*  
- Johnathan Blake - *Trion*

### Village Vanguard, March 20-22 - The Aaron Parks Quartet  
Aaron Parks is one of the greatest and most-emulated modern jazz piano players alive today. His phrasing and percussive style of playing have pushed modern jazz piano in a fresh direction, following greats like McCoy Tyner and Kenny Kirkland, who favored more harmonic substitutions in their playing.  

If you’re into modern jazz piano, this is who you need to see.

**Listening guide:**  
- Aaron Parks - *Invisible Cinema*  
- Kurt Rosenwinkel - *Star of Jupiter*  

### Zinc Bar, March 25 - Sam Dillon Quartet  
A special mention for my friend Sam Dillon, who is playing at Zinc Bar next Tuesday. An absolute monster tenor saxophone player and a sweetheart of a human being. He’s been a staple of the NYC jazz scene for years now. I highly recommend checking him out if you have some time after work.
